   "Description": "Mar 26, 2022\nUnbelievable prices, quality and selection!\nI needed a dress for a friend’s daughter’s wedding and was dreading paying a hefty price for something I probably wouldn’t wear again. When I found thedressoutlet.com site I saw a dress I had bought for my own daughter’s wedding for less than half the price I paid. It made me check them out further. I then saw 4 dresses that I really liked and the prices were so good I thought I would take a chance. What I was expecting to pay for one dress was what it cost me for those four. They all came within a week and three were just gorgeous! Excellent quality too. I love them soooo much. One had a flaw and when I notified the company through email late on a Saturday night they responded within an hour. I sent them photos and they sent me a return label shortly after. This company’s customer service was top notch. I can’t say enough about them and am telling all my friends to check them out!",

My family and I picked out two potential dresses for my grandmother to wear at her funeral. She specifically wanted a salmon gown and we wanted to honor her wish. We made the purchase on Saturday and paid extra for 3 day shipping as it was needed by Wednesday by the funeral home. It arrived on Thursday. The funeral home was willing to work with us but we did find a replacement \"just in case\" and I reached out to the company to get reimbursed only for the 3 day shipped we paid for. They would not reimburse us. I let them know I wanted to return both and asked for a call tag. No call tags are given AND they charge a 20% re stocking fee... apparently to keep \"prices low\" .. low being $100 a piece. I will never work with this company again and I hope if you are in a crunch for time you steer clear. Obviously the sizing didnt matter much here but IF the sizes didnt fit I cant imagine paying 20% restocking just to return a dress. absolutely terrible experience during a really tough time in our lives.",

My family and I picked out two potential dresses for my grandmother to wear at her funeral. She specifically wanted a salmon gown and we wanted to honor her wish. We made the purchase on Saturday and paid extra for 3 day shipping as it was needed by Wednesday by the funeral home. It arrived on Thursday. The funeral home was willing to work with us but we did find a replacement \"just in case\" and I reached out to the company to get reimbursed only for the 3 day shipped we paid for. They would not reimburse us. I let them know I wanted to return both and asked for a call tag. No call tags are given AND they charge a 20% re stocking fee... apparently to keep \"prices low\" .. low being $100 a piece. I will never work with this company again and I hope if you are in a crunch for time you steer clear. Obviously the sizing didnt matter much here but IF the sizes didnt fit I cant imagine paying 20% restocking just to return a dress. absolutely terrible experience during a really tough time in our lives.",

I am a plus size person and so is my daughter and I am just so unbelievably happy that they have a large variety of plus size dresses to choose from. By the way, the dress I did order for my daughter runs a little big which was a good thing also because for plus size women they all seem to run small.

I was able to easily search size charts and while I ordered a size too big, the exchange policy was simple. I received my exchange within a few days and it is PERFECT. The service I received throughout was what you'd expect from a high end store without the aggravation of being in a store. I will purchase from them in the future and would highly recommend them.",

She wanted to take my order and by the time we got to that, the size was no longer available. However I said if I find something else I will ask her to order it for me. I thanked her. Nice to have someone to chat with if problems occur. By the way, I did not like the return policy. I like to get credit back on my credit card. Not store credit.",

My family and I picked out two potential dresses for my grandmother to wear at her funeral. She specifically wanted a salmon gown and we wanted to honor her wish. We made the purchase on Saturday and paid extra for 3 day shipping as it was needed by Wednesday by the funeral home. It arrived on Thursday. The funeral home was willing to work with us but we did find a replacement \"just in case\" and I reached out to the company to get reimbursed only for the 3 day shipped we paid for. They would not reimburse us. I let them know I wanted to return both and asked for a call tag. No call tags are given AND they charge a 20% re stocking fee... apparently to keep \"prices low\" .. low being $100 a piece. I will never work with this company again and I hope if you are in a crunch for time you steer clear. Obviously the sizing didnt matter much here but IF the sizes didnt fit I cant imagine paying 20% restocking just to return a dress. absolutely terrible experience during a really tough time in our lives.",

I opened chat on the website and asked about it and promptly received an answer from Britney that the other dress was on the way! I am very pleased with the dress that has arrived already. It is beautiful on my daughter! I hope that the one I ordered for myself is just as pretty and fits the same way as hers does! I will definitely keep thedressoutlet.com in my bookmarks for future purchases. I am a plus size person and so is my daughter and I am just so unbelievably happy that they have a large variety of plus size dresses to choose from. By the way, the dress I did order for my daughter runs a little big which was a good thing also because for plus size women they all seem to run small. So, I was pleasantly surprised that it had some room in it.",

It is now 8/18/21, and the ensemble has still not been delivered. I did return to the Dress Outlet website and start a chat to inform the customer service rep* that I was canceling the order and not paying any \"restocking fee.\"\n*Brittany typed that the full amount would be credited to my credit card account. We shall see.\nThis is a ridiculous business model. Since I wasn't ordering through Amazon, I wasn't expecting next-day delivery, but I did expect the order to arrive within 14 days. It makes me question my efforts to order directly from merchants to avoid Amazon when possible. What I have learned from this experience is that Amazon's clients offer quicker turn-around and are much more reliable.",
