We don't do exchanges, but it's faster to order your new dress now, and return the one you don't want back to us for a refund instead. Our turnaround time for a dress is done quickly to ensure you have your dress on time.<br\/><br\/>To return your dress, an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number is required, otherwise we will not process a return. A return must be requested within 1-week of the delivery date. Anything over 1-week from delivery, regardless of the situation, will NOT be honored. We charge a 20% restocking fee for a returned dress. We also offer store credit with no restocking fee and a $10 bonus credit. Bear in mind the bonus credit is once per order. You cannot stack bonus credit. You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedressoutlet.com\/apps\/redo\/returns-portal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Returns | The Dress Outlet\"><strong>visit our Returns Portal<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>to submit your RMA request.<br\/><br\/>Please bear in mind, The Dress Outlet does not profit whatsoever from restocking fees. The restocking fees are solely used to ensure that our prices are low.<br\/><br\/>If you are purchasing more than 1 piece, our customer experience team will be contacting you to confirm a restocking fee before shipping out your order. Because the order has multiple pieces, the restocking fee will vary from the original 20%.<br\/><br\/>While most orders will fall under the default 20% restocking fee, there are some orders that may be subject to a higher restocking fee than normal due to the dress being a special order. In either case, our customer experience team will reach out to you to confirm with you.<br\/><br\/>ALL RETURN SHIPPING COSTS ARE HANDLED BY THE CUSTOMER AND NOT THE DRESS OUTLET UNLESS THE DRESS IS DAMAGED, OR INCORRECT. IF THE DRESS IS DAMAGED, YOU NEED TO CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY. ALL ITEMS MUST BE RETURNED WITH ALL OF THE ORIGINAL TAGS, AND PLASTIC BAGS STILL INTACT AND ON THE DRESS. IF THE DRESS IS NOT RETURNED IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO NOT HONOR THE RMA, REFUND, AND CUSTOMER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHIPPING BACK TO THEIR ADDRESS.<br\/><br\/>ALL SALE ITEMS, AND CLOSEOUT ITEMS ARE FINAL SALE. NO RETURNS. NO REFUNDS. NO EXCHANGES. SALE\/CLOSEOUT ITEMS WILL HAVE A RED \"SALE\" ON OUR WEBSITE, AND THE PRICE WILL BE COLORED IN RED INSTEAD OF BLACK AND YOU SHOULD SEE A WARNING AT CHECKOUT.<\/p>",
